# My Portfolio (React + Vite)

Showcasing my projects, skills, and professional journey with a fast, modern, and maintainable frontend stack.

</div>

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio built with **React 19** and **Vite (rolldown-vite)**. It serves as a central hub where visitors can:

- Explore featured projects and case studies
- View my technical skill set and toolchain
- Read brief experience highlights / timeline
- Access contact and social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email, etc.)
- (Optionally) Interact with live demos or embedded components

## 💡 What Is a Portfolio & Why It Matters

A developer portfolio is more than a gallery—it is a curated narrative of capability, credibility, and growth.

Key benefits:

1. Proof of execution: Real code and shipped features speak louder than a résumé bullet.
2. Differentiation: Highlights depth (architecture choices, performance, UX polish) not visible on a CV.
3. Discoverability: Central place to collect repos, talks, blog posts, and open‑source contributions.
4. Trust building: Signals professionalism, consistency, and attention to detail.
5. Conversion: Encourages recruiters, clients, or collaborators to reach out with clear CTAs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Framework | React 19 | Modern features + compiler (experimental) |
| Bundler/Dev Server | Vite (rolldown-vite) | Fast HMR + optimized build |
| Language | JavaScript (ES Modules) | TypeScript can be added later |
| Styling | CSS (global + component) | Located in `src/App.css`, `src/index.css` |
| Linting | ESLint 9 | Enforces code quality (`npm run lint`) |

The **React Compiler** (experimental) is enabled via `babel-plugin-react-compiler` to optimize rendering. See the official [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for caveats. It may slightly affect dev/build performance.

## 🚀 Features (Planned / Implemented)

- Responsive layout for desktop & mobile
- Project cards with links and tech badges
- Skills section (grouped by category)
- Contact / call-to-action section
- Performance-focused build pipeline
- Easy extensibility for blog or dark mode

## Pages and routes

This project registers its client-side routes in `src/App.jsx` using React Router. The main pages and their component files are:

- `/` — Home (component: `src/home.jsx`)
- `/about` — About (component: `src/about.jsx`)
- `/projects` — Projects (component: `src/project.jsx`)
- `/contact` — Contact (component: `src/contact.jsx`)
- `/journey` — Journey (component: `src/journey.jsx`)
- `/resume` — Resume (component: `src/resume.jsx`)

The top navigation bar is implemented in `src/navbar.jsx` and styled in `src/navbar.css`. It uses `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` components for client-side navigation and includes a simple mobile menu toggle.

To add a new page: create a React component in `src/`, then register a route in `src/App.jsx` (see the `createBrowserRouter` usage).

## Featured projects & styling

The home page exposes a small "Featured Projects" area implemented in `src/home.jsx` and styled in `src/home.css`.

- Structure: the projects area is a container with the class `.projects-list`. Each project is represented by an anchor (rendered by `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` in this project) and an adjacent metadata block (title/description) — see `src/home.jsx` for the exact markup.
- Styling: `src/home.css` defines a `.project` rule (card size, border-radius, background settings) and three ID-based selectors (`#project1`, `#project2`, `#project3`) that set background images for each featured card.
- Runtime class assignment: a small JavaScript `useEffect` in `src/home.jsx` selects the rendered anchors inside `.projects-list` and adds the `project` class at runtime. This keeps styling centralized in CSS while still allowing the markup to be generated by React.
- Assets: background images referenced from the project cards live alongside your home styles (the current CSS uses `./images/Project.png`, etc.). Keep those images in `src/images` or `public` depending on your bundling preference.

Notes & accessibility:

- External links: if a project link navigates to an external site (for example a deployed demo on Vercel), prefer using a plain `<a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` so the browser handles external navigation and users get an expected "open in new tab" experience.
- Semantic text: include visible titles and descriptions (as in the example `h4` / `h5` markup) to ensure cards are accessible to screen readers and keyboard users.

## About page & styling

The About page lives in `src/about.jsx` and its styles are in `src/about.css`.

- Structure: the top-level container uses the `.about-page` class and is split into `.about-image` (left) and `.about-text` (right). The image is implemented as a decorative background on a `.image` element (`background-image: url(/src/images/about_image.png)`) while the textual content contains headings, a short bio and a set of progress bars indicating skill levels.
- Progress bars: the CSS defines a `.progress-bar` container and a few fill classes (`.progress-fill`, `.progress-fill-2`, `.progress-fill-3`) where the `width` CSS property controls the visible percentage (70%, 60%, 75% in the current stylesheet). If you want dynamic control (from props/state) consider toggling classes or setting an inline style (e.g. style={{ width: `${value}%` }}) from React instead of hardcoding values in CSS.
- Image assets: `about.css` references `/src/images/about_image.png`. With Vite it's generally better to either import images in the component (import aboutImage from './images/about_image.png') and use them in `style` or place them in `public/` and reference `/images/about_image.png` so the path is stable across builds.

Important note (JSX compatibility)

- In `src/about.jsx` there are several DOM attributes using standard HTML `class` instead of React's `className` (for example `<div class="progress-bar">`). This will cause warnings or unexpected behavior when JSX is compiled — please replace `class` with `className` throughout JSX files so React can apply classes correctly.

Accessibility & semantics

- Decorative background images should include an accessible alternative for screen readers; since a `div` with a background image has no `alt`, include an adjacent visually-hidden `img` or add `aria-label`/`role="img"` with an appropriate `aria-label` describing the image if it's meaningful.
- Consider replacing decorative containers with semantic elements (`<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`) where appropriate to improve document structure.
- The progress bars are visual only; add textual equivalents (e.g., "Front-end — 70%") for screen readers or add `aria-valuenow` / `role="progressbar"` with min/max attributes if you want assistive tech to interpret them as progress controls.

Developer tips

- If you plan to animate or update progress values, expose the numeric value from state/props and compute `style={{ width: value + '%' }}` on the fill element instead of editing the CSS each time.
- Keep image assets organized under `src/images` if you want them bundled, or move them to `public/` for direct static paths.

## 🧩 Scripts

## Contact page & form

The contact page is implemented in `src/contact.jsx` and styled in `src/contact.css`.

- Form handling: the page contains a simple contact form that gathers name, email, subject and message and submits via a client-side `fetch` to the Web3Forms API (`https://api.web3forms.com/submit`). The example code appends an `access_key` before submitting and reads the JSON reply to show success/failure messages.
- UI behaviour: on a successful submit the component toggles a `.successful-msg` element (shown) and hides the main `.contact-page` content temporarily, then resets the form and restores the page after a short timeout — see `src/contact.jsx` for the exact flow.
- Assets: icons used by the contact page reference local images (for example `./images/email.png` and `./images/social.png`). Store these assets either in `src/images` and import them (as the component currently does) or place them in `public/` and reference absolute paths depending on your preferred bundling strategy.

Security & best practice notes

- Do not commit secrets: the example app currently sets an `access_key` value inline before sending the form. For production, move secrets or keys into environment variables on the server or use a server-side endpoint to proxy submissions so secrets remain out of the client bundle.
- External links and mailto: the component uses `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` for a `mailto:` link and for the GitHub URL. For mailto and other external URLs prefer a plain `<a href="mailto:...">` or `<a href="https://..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` so the browser handles them as expected.

Accessibility

- The form uses `required` attributes for basic HTML validation, but consider adding explicit `<label>` elements associated with inputs (or aria-label attributes) to improve screen-reader support.
- Ensure that success/failure messages are announced to assistive technologies (for example by using `role="status"` or `aria-live="polite"` on the result container).

## 📦 Deployment Notes

- The `dist/` folder is static—host on Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.
- Ensure proper routing (if later adding React Router) by configuring a fallback HTML.
- Add analytics or error monitoring (e.g., Umami, Sentry) as needed.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Dark / light theme toggle
- Project data sourced from a JSON or CMS (e.g., Contentful, Sanity)
- Blog / articles section
- Lighthouse performance tuning & metrics badge
- Unit and accessibility tests

## 🤝 Contributing / Personalization

This is a personal project, but you can fork it to bootstrap your own portfolio. Replace project data, images in `src/assets/`, and tweak layout/styles in `App.jsx` & CSS files.

## 🎯 Quick badges

You can add badges (build, lint, coverage) at the top of this README. Example markup for GitHub Actions or a linter badge:

```markdown
![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)
![eslint](https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-enabled-4B32C3)
```

## 🛠️ How to customize

- Replace project content in `src/` (images in `src/assets/`, page text in `home.jsx`, `about.jsx`, etc.).
- To add a new page, create a component in `src/` and register a route in `src/App.jsx` using `createBrowserRouter`.
- For global styles, edit `src/index.css`; for component styles, update or create CSS files next to components.

## ⚙️ Deployment notes (short)

- `npm run build` produces a static `dist/` folder. Deploy `dist/` to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages).
- If you deploy to a platform that needs a fallback for client-side routing, set the rewrite/fallback to `index.html`.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting & tips

- If HMR isn't updating components, restart the dev server and clear the browser cache.
- If you see dependency errors after upgrading Node, remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again.
